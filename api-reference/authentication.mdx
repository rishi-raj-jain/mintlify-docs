The Neon API requires that you include an API key token in an Authorization header in your API request.

The Neon API uses _Bearer Token Authentication_, which means that you must format your Authorization header like this:

`-H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'`

For example:

```curl
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

To try an API request in your browser from this page, enter your token in the **Bearer** prompt after clicking the **Try It** button on any Neon API endpoint, which you can select from the sidebar.

[Get a list of projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) is an easy endpoint to try, as it only requires an API key token. 

## Neon API keys

A Neon API key is a randomly-generated 64-bit token that remains valid until it is revoked. 

To create an API key:

1. Navigate to the [API Keys](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **Create new API key**.
3. Enter a name for the API key.
4. Click **Create** and copy the generated token.

Store your token in a safe location. You will not be able to view or copy the token again after leaving the **API keys** page in the Neon Console. 

For more information about managing Neon API keys, refer to [Manage API keys](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys) in the _Neon documentation_.
