## Introduction

The Neon API allows you to manage Neon programmatically. With the Neon API, you can create and manage all objects in your Neon account, including:

- API keys
- Projects
- Branches
- Compute endpoints
- Databases
- Roles

> Databases and roles belong to branches and are therefore managed with _Branch_ endpoints. Look under **Branch** in the sidebar for database and role endpoints.

For information about the Neon objects listed above, refer to [Overview of the Neon object hierarchy](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/overview), in the _Neon documentation_.

## Neon API base URL

The base URL for a Neon API request is:

`https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/`

Append a Neon API endpoint path to the base URL to construct the full URL for a request. For example:

`https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}`

## Neon API examples

For Neon API examples, refer to the following topics in the _Neon documentation_:

- [Manage API keys with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#manage-api-keys-with-the-neon-api)
- [Manage projects with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/projects#manage-projects-with-the-neon-api)
- [Manage branches with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/branches#branching-with-the-neon-api)
- [Manage compute endpoints with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/endpoints#manage-compute-endpoints-with-the-neon-api)
- [Manage roles with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-the-neon-api)
- [Manage databases with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/databases#manage-databases-with-the-neon-api)
- [View operations with the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/operations#view-operations-with-the-neon-api)

> When using the Neon API programmatically, you can poll the operation status to ensure that an operation is finished before proceeding with the next API request. For more information, see [Poll operation status](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/operations#poll-operation-status).
